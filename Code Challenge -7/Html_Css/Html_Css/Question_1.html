        <b>Dihydrogen monoxide</b>, also known as 
        <!--4. Emphasize (italicize) the first occurrence of hydroxyl acid and DHMO-->

        <i>hydroxyl acid</i> or <i>DHMO</i>
        <!--5. All numbers except the 2 in H2O should be superscripted l-->
        
        <sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>: <br>
        is the major component of acid rain, <br>
        contributes to the greenhouse effect, <br>
        may cause severe burns, <br>
        is fatal if inhaled, <br>
        contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape, <br>
        accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, <br>
        may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes, <br>
        and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.

    <p>
        Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: <br>
        as an industrial solvent and coolant, <br>
        in nuclear power plants, <br>
        <!--6. Mark the letters TM behind Styrofoam as superscript.-->
    
        in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>, <br>
        as a fire retardant, <br>
        in many forms of cruel animal research, <br>
        as an additive in certain junk foods and other food products, <br>
        in the distribution of pesticides. <br>
        Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
